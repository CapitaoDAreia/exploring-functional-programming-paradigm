    HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION:
    - A higher order function is a function that operates in other functions,
    taking this other functions as arguments or returning them.

    "A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, 
    or returns a function. Higher order function is in contrast to first order functions,
    which donâ€™t take a function as an argument or return a function as output."
